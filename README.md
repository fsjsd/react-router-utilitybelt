# React Router Utility Belt

Opinionated react-router UI components with unopinionated styling!

[![Edit react-router-utilitybelt](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/fsjsd/react-router-utilitybelt/tree/master/?fontsize=14)

Helps solve some common real world navigation concerns with React Router, like:

- :gem: Single "source of truth" for route defintions to prevent multiple nav components repeating data
- :+1: Drawer navigation with automatic grouping and filtering
- :zap: Sub navigation generation
- :bread: Automatic breadcrumb generation
- :open_mouth: Render current route information outside your main Route declaration

This example focuses purely on react router concepts. Libraries like [connected react router](https://github.com/chriswebbsydney/connected-react-router) are great but the goal of this project is to allow you to implement React Router without any add on dependencies.

No other 3rd party packages are used so you can reason about what's going on without extra mental tax.
